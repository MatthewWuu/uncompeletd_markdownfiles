What_Is_This_About
------
This file $\rightarrow$ ***"UNIX programming course on COURSERA"***  was designed for those who are taking the elementary GNU/linux_bash_programming course on Coursera, namely [The Unix Workbence](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix/home/welcome). 

The initial propuse to wirte this article is to collect the **key points/takeways** and also add some **extensions** which i thought would be helpful for understanding during the learning process. As such, some parts such as "*enumerating all sorts of command lines*" are slimmed down(you can straightly look them up when you need); some interesting parts like "*what's the difference between 'origin' and 'master' on git*" will be expanded.

You may take this as an extra note, so just help yourself to it since it's not copyrightable. This project is still building up at this stage, please correct me if you caught the mistakes ; )
