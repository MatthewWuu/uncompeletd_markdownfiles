----

+ **rigid body** $def:=$ All points on the body have the same angular velocity/accelerations;

-Rotational directions
radial 
rotational

+ rotiaonal vs. traslation

> Note: linear=translational motion

+ Reference line to measure

+  Compare $\theta$ and $d(displacement)$ within two different models 
  $$
  
  \ \theta= 5 \ rev \ (revolution)\\
     \theta=5*(2\pi)=10 \pi
  $$
  θ here can be taken as the path in the linear motions. The unit is rad.

+ Three diff. accelerations
  **tangential**(切向加速度) 
+ **versus radial accel**.（径向加速度）**/ centripetal accel.**(向心加速度)  $\rightarrow  have\ same\ Unit \ (m/s^2)$

+ Kinetic energy of rotation   

​    The kinetic energy is calculated differently because if we do it as it in the linear motion, about the center of rotation/center of mass, it equal zero.

So we should do it in diff way. <u>By the **Newton's first law**, we know that the inertia($I$) is proportional to mass</u>($m$).$*$ . So the moment of inertia be, too.(惯性和转动惯量)

$$
K={1\over2} \ I\ w^2
$$
I= sum of (mr^2) (for discrete mass), where r stands for the  dist. betw. the com of each object to the axis of rotation.

+ Parallel-axis Theorem

$$
I=Icom+Mh^2
$$

where $I_{com}$  is the inertia about center of , $M$ is the mass of the whole body, $h$ is a dist. betw two parallel axes<u>(from one to the shifted one).</u>

> **Note**: when there is a "particle", we can always use $I=mr^2 $



####***Torque*: =change the rotational motions**

---

**Contributing Factors**：

+ magnitude of torque;
+ dist betw the $F$ and aixs of rotation/radius;
+ angle betw applied F and radius;  $\tau \ = F_{perp}* r(radius)$

+ some formula transformations 

$$
\tau = r\ F_t =r\ F sin\varphi= r_{\perp} F
$$

> **Note**: the clockwise is negative; counterclockwise is positive;



Similar to the linear motion model, Torque has is way to be well defined. Applied in the **Newton's Second Law for Rotation** the **net torque** is represented as 
$$
\tau = \alpha \ (angular\ accel.)*I
$$
comparing with $F=ma$, by Newton's First law $*$, the $m$ can be taken as $I$, $I \equiv m$. The units are the same as what is in the linear motion $N\ m$.

####**Work done by the Torque**

----

 Another similarity between. $F$ and $\tau$ is the **work**.

> work done by the force:   $W=\int^{s_1}_{s_2}Fds$ 
>
> work done by the torque: $W=\int^{\alpha_1}_{\alpha_2}\tau d\alpha$
